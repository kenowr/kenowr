# Homepage of Kenneth Ooi

Hi! I'm Kenneth, and I'm currently a PhD student at the School of Electrical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My current research focuses on developing artificial intelligence techniques for soundscape augmentation, but I dabble in other projects related to soundscapes and acoustics here and there.

## About this page

This page lists down a selection of publications that I have led or have been involved in, accompanied with publicly-accessible, paywall-free links to resources related to those publications. Publications are listed in reverse chronological order of publication/presentation date under their respective section headings. In addition to my publications, I have also included some code snippets and resources that I have created/used myself over the course of teaching content related to university-level courses.

Generally, links to the different resources are classified under the following types:
- [[manuscript]]: Full-texts of the publication uploaded to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), the [NTU Digital Repository](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/), or other publicly-available locations.
- [[overleaf]]: Source TeX and PDF files of supplementary material I created/used for teaching of university-level course content, hosted on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
- [[code]]: Code repositories or replication code for the publication uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or the [NTU Data Repository](https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/).
- [[dataset]]: Datasets or replication data for the publication stored on the [NTU Data Repository](https://researchdata.ntu.edu.sg/).
- [[video]]: Presentation video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) explaining or describing content within the publication.
- [[demo]]: Demos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) showing an embodiment of the system described within the publication.
